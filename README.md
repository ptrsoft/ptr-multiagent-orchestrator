## What's the Multi-Agent Orchestrator ‚ùì

The Multi-Agent Orchestrator is a flexible framework for managing multiple AI agents and handling complex conversations. It intelligently routes queries and maintains context across interactions.

The system offers pre-built components for quick deployment, while also allowing easy integration of custom agents and conversation messages storage solutions.

This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple chatbots to sophisticated AI systems, accommodating diverse requirements and scaling efficiently.

<br /><br />

1. The process begins with user input, which is analyzed by a Classifier.
2. The Classifier leverages both Agents' Characteristics and Agents' Conversation history to select the most appropriate agent for the task.
3. Once an agent is selected, it processes the user input.
4. The orchestrator then saves the conversation, updating the Agents' Conversation history, before delivering the response back to the user.


## ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/multi-agent-orchestrator/main/img/new.png) Introducing SupervisorAgent: Agents Coordination

The Multi-Agent Orchestrator now includes a powerful new SupervisorAgent that enables sophisticated team coordination between multiple specialized agents. This new component implements a "agent-as-tools" architecture, allowing a lead agent to coordinate a team of specialized agents in parallel, maintaining context and delivering coherent responses.

![SupervisorAgent flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/multi-agent-orchestrator/main/img/flow-supervisor.jpg)

Key capabilities:
- ü§ù **Team Coordination** - Coordonate multiple specialized agents working together on complex tasks
- ‚ö° **Parallel Processing** - Execute multiple agent queries simultaneously
- üß† **Smart Context Management** - Maintain conversation history across all team members
- üîÑ **Dynamic Delegation** - Intelligently distribute subtasks to appropriate team members
- ü§ñ **Agent Compatibility** - Works with all agent types (Bedrock, Anthropic, Lex, etc.)

The SupervisorAgent can be used in two powerful ways:
1. **Direct Usage** - Call it directly when you need dedicated team coordination for specific tasks
2. **Classifier Integration** - Add it as an agent within the classifier to build complex hierarchical systems with multiple specialized teams

Here are just a few examples where this agent can be used:
- Customer Support Teams with specialized sub-teams
- AI Movie Production Studios
- Travel Planning Services
- Product Development Teams
- Healthcare Coordination Systems

## üí¨ Demo App

In the screen recording below, we demonstrate an extended version of the demo app that uses 6 specialized agents:
- **Travel Agent**: Powered by an Amazon Lex Bot
- **Weather Agent**: Utilizes a Bedrock LLM Agent with a tool to query the open-meteo API
- **Restaurant Agent**: Implemented as an Amazon Bedrock Agent
- **Math Agent**: Utilizes a Bedrock LLM Agent with two tools for executing mathematical operations
- **Tech Agent**: A Bedrock LLM Agent designed to answer questions on technical topics
- **Health Agent**: A Bedrock LLM Agent focused on addressing health-related queries

Watch as the system seamlessly switches context between diverse topics, from booking flights to checking weather, solving math problems, and providing health information.
Notice how the appropriate agent is selected for each query, maintaining coherence even with brief follow-up inputs.

The demo highlights the system's ability to handle complex, multi-turn conversations while preserving context and leveraging specialized agents across various domains.

    ))
)

async def main():
    # Example usage
    response = await orchestrator.route_request(
        "I want to book a flight",
        'user123',
        'session456'
    )

    # Handle the response (streaming or non-streaming)
    if response.streaming:
        print("\n** RESPONSE STREAMING ** \n")
        # Send metadata immediately
        print(f"> Agent ID: {response.metadata.agent_id}")
        print(f"> Agent Name: {response.metadata.agent_name}")
        print(f"> User Input: {response.metadata.user_input}")
        print(f"> User ID: {response.metadata.user_id}")
        print(f"> Session ID: {response.metadata.session_id}")
        print(f"> Additional Parameters: {response.metadata.additional_params}")
        print("\n> Response: ")

        # Stream the content
        async for chunk in response.output:
            if isinstance(chunk, str):
                print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
            else:
                print(f"Received unexpected chunk type: {type(chunk)}", file=sys.stderr)

    else:
        # Handle non-streaming response (AgentProcessingResult)
        print("\n** RESPONSE ** \n")
        print(f"> Agent ID: {response.metadata.agent_id}")
        print(f"> Agent Name: {response.metadata.agent_name}")
        print(f"> User Input: {response.metadata.user_input}")
        print(f"> User ID: {response.metadata.user_id}")
        print(f"> Session ID: {response.metadata.session_id}")
        print(f"> Additional Parameters: {response.metadata.additional_params}")
        print(f"\n> Response: {response.output.content}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

These examples showcase:
1. The use of a Bedrock LLM Agent with Converse API support, allowing for multi-turn conversations.
2. Integration of a Lex Bot Agent for specialized tasks (in this case, travel-related queries).
